    <title>Printing Under Unix (GTK+)</title>
    <briefdescription>
<para><linebreak/>
 Printing under Unix has always been a cause of problems as Unix does not provide a standard way to display text and graphics on screen and print it to a printer using the same application programming interface - instead, displaying on screen is done via the X11 library while printing has to be done with using PostScript commands. </para>    </briefdescription>

 Printing under Unix has always been a cause of problems as Unix does not provide a standard way to display text and graphics on screen and print it to a printer using the same application programming interface - instead, displaying on screen is done via the X11 library while printing has to be done with using PostScript commands.</para><para>This was particularly difficult to handle for the case of fonts with the result that only a selected number of application could offer WYSIWYG under Unix. Equally, wxWidgets offered its own printing implementation using PostScript which never really matched the screen display.</para><para>Since GTK+ 2.10, support for printing has been added to GTK+ itself and beginning with wxWidgets 2.9, GTK+ printing is used by default (i.e. unless <computeroutput><ndash/>without-gtkprint</computeroutput> was explicitly used when configuring the library). Support for GTK+ print is detected dynamically, i.e. during the run-time: if it is found, printing will be done through GTK+, otherwise the application will fall back to the old PostScript printing code. This allows the applications built with wxWidgets to still work on the very old systems using GTK+ earlier than 2.10. </para>    </detaileddescription>
